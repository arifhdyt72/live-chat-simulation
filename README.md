## 📦 Modules & Layers

- **WebSocket Layer:** Manages real-time messaging, typing, and status updates.
- **Message Handler:** Processes all incoming messages and triggers appropriate logic (e.g. store, broadcast, upload).
- **Redis Pub/Sub:** Distributes messages across instances (horizontal scaling).
- **MongoDB:** Stores chat messages, user data, and media metadata.
- **S3 Integration:** Uploads and retrieves media files (images, videos, recordings).
- **Admin API:** Backend services for chat admin dashboard.
- **Middleware:** Handles auth, logging, and request pre/post-processing.
- **File Processor:** Manages temporary image storage and background upload.
- **Logger:** Outputs system logs to a file with rotation support.
